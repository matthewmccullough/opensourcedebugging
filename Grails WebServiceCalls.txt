#GET ALL SHOWS via REST as XML
curl -i -H "Accept: text/xml" -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShows/
#GET ALL SHOWS via REST as JSON
curl -i -H "Accept: text/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShows/
#or with the content type (which really signals what is going in, not out, but it works anyway)
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShows/
#but not without accept type (REJECTED)
curl -i http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShows/
#or a crazy type (ALSO REJECTED)
curl -i -H "Accept: text/garbage" -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShows/

#GET ALL SHOWS via HTML
curl -i http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/carShow/list



#GET ONE SHOW via REST
curl -i -H "Accept: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1
#or with the content type
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1
#or with JSON
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/json" http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1
but not
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1

#CONTENT TYPE DETECTION on HTML CONTROLLER
#GET ONE SHOW VIA HTML
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/carShow/show/1
curl -i -H "Accept: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/carShow/show/1



#DELETE SHOW 1 via REST, blows up because of automatic XML parsing unless we pass a data block of XML
curl -i -H "Accept: text/xml" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1
#passing a data block of XML with the ID
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow --data "<carShow id=\"1\"/>"
#and also works without the content type since it doesn't try to parse the XML and we allow HTML on this controller
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/1



#SAVE A NEW SHOW
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/ --data "<carShow><city>NEWNEW</city><minimumCompetitors>6</minimumCompetitors><state>NEW</state><venue>NEW</venue></carShow>"
#FAIL: but you can't use accept type, as it only controls the READER methods, not the SAVING ones, or it doesn't parse the XML
curl -i -H "Accept: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/ --data "<carShow><city>NEWNEW</city><minimumCompetitors>6</minimumCompetitors><state>NEW</state><venue>NEW</venue></carShow>"
#Save a show via JSON
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/JackedUpApp2/rest/carShow/ --data "{\"class\":\"CarShow\",\"city\":\"NEWJSON\",\"minimumCompetitors\":77,\"state\":\"NEWJSON\",\"venue\":\"NEWJSON\"}"


#UPDATE A SHOW
